## This is the repository for the development of the webapp Random Walker

The app generates a random location based on the current location and
provide direction to the destination for explorers.

The purpose of the application to transform everyone into an
explorer. It doesn't take a big trip to explore something entirely
new, man kind has explored every land part of the planet, but each
individual has only been exposed to a very tiny fraction. We want
everyone to have the sensation of exploring regardless of your budget,
time and confidence.

Whether it be a local suburb you have never been before or the wildest
dream amongst the amazon, exploring is merely experience something you
have not experienced before. Further, we hope this would help people
lacking confidence to start travelling more and more.
