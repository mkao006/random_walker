## This is the repository for the development of the webapp Random Walker

### Statement

The application generates a random location based on the current
location and provide direction to the destination for exploration

The purpose of the application to transform everyone into an
explorer. It doesn't take a big trip to explore something entirely
new, mankind have explored every land constitution of the planet, but
each individual has only been exposed to a very tiny fraction. We want
everyone to have the sensation of exploring regardless of your budget,
time and confidence.

Whether it be a local suburb you have never been before or the wildest
dream amongst the amazon, exploring should be associated with
sensation you have not experienced before. Further, we hope this would
help people lacking confidence and experience to start travelling more
and more.

### Explorer

Here we define an exploration as reaching a destination that does not
have associated data in the OpenStreetMap (need to refine this
definition).

This gives us the opportunity to assist in the data collection by
enabling explorers to contribute to the data collection of
OpenStreetMap.
