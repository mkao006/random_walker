## Inspiration
A blog functionality to share location and moments of adventure.

Should also share the relative location for other Walkers to explore
and attempt to find the same location as a game with rewards.

Inspiration should be classified, we want to avoid spams and promote
only real exploration experience.

Inspiration should also be location adjusted.

## Social Platform
A social platform to facilitate adventures.

Friends who have saved the same location will be notified that their
companions are also interested in visiting the place and can travel
together.

Friends can only be added with trip information. How did you met, the
location and possibly a story.
